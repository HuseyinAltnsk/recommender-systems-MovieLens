# Collaborative-Filtering and Content-Based Recommender Systems for MovieLens Items
Recommender system implementations using several popular algorithms to recommend MovieLens items to a set of users. The applied algorithms were improved for better accuracy using __Leave-One-Out Cross Validation__, **P-value Hypothesis Testing**, similarity metrics like __Pearson Correlation__, __Euclidean Distance__ and error metrics like __MSE, MAE and RMSE__. Below is a list of the algorithms implemented under each type of recommender system.

### Collaborative-filtering RS algorithms
  * User-to-user recommendations (U-U)
  * Item-to-item recommendations (I-I)
  * Matrix Factorization: Stochastic Gradient Descent (MF-SGD)
  * Matrix Factorization: Alternating Least Squares (MF-ALS)

### Content-based RS algorithms
  * Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) with Cosine Similarity
  * Feature Encoding
