# Collaborative-Filtering and Content-Based Recommender Systems for MovieLens Items
Recommender system implementations using several popular algorithms to recommend MovieLens items to a set of users. The applied algorithms were improved for better accuracy using Leave-One-Out Cross Validation, P-value Hypothesis Testing and error metrics like MSE, MAE and RMSE. Below is a list of the algorithms implemented under each type of recommender system.

### Collaborative-filtering RS algorithms
  User-to-user recommendations (U-U)
  Item-to-item recommendations (I-I)
  Matrix Factorization: Stocastic Gradient Descent (MF-SGD)
  Matrix Factorization: Alternating Least Squares (MF-ALS)

### Content-based RS algorithms
  Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) with Cosine Similarity
  Feature Encoding
